# RPG
A personal project to review concepts and have fun creating a program in C, using ADT, for queues and linked lists, to organize the initiative of players and monsters in an RPG.

# How to use:

Create the characters, adding their life, initiative, and name. If you want to create monsters, it's also possible, but their initiative will be randomly decided between 1 and 20. Then, start the game, where you will have access to the creatures (players and monsters) in order of initiative.
